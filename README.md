# Interpreter_V3
A Scheme to C++ interpreter.

This project was built in 3 major iterations: 

Iteration 1: 
    For this iteration, the goal was to design and 
    construct a lexical analyzer for the language 
    scheme. This included recognizing lexemes 
    for identifiers, numeric literals and 
    all symbols listed in the grammar PDF within 
    this repository. After the input file is read 
    in, the lexical analyzer outputs a listing file, 
    a token file and a debugging file. The listing 
    file contains the lines of the input file with 
    line numbers and errors. The token file
    contains a list of the tokens identified in
    the file and their corresponding lexemes.

Iteration 2:
